h1. Wee Beastie

Rewrite of SavageBeast to work with Rails 2.3.x as a rails engine.

h2. Install

* script/plugin install git://github.com/pyrat/wee_beastie.git
* rake wee_beastie:install
* rake db:migrate

Add the following 2 lines to environment.rb

* config.active_record.default_timezone = :utc
* config.reload_plugins = true

Code specific

* include WeeBeastie::UserInit into your user model
* setup the user.forum_admin attribute to true to allow you to administer and setup the forums.

h2. TODO

* Currently there is no out of the box way to create moderatorships. You need to add the create moderatorship links in your user administraion.

h2. Notes

* You need to have rsync installed for the install process.

* Wee Beastie plays best with the Resful Authentication plugin but any authentication can be used if the *current_user* and *logged_in?* methods are implemented. It has also been successfully integrated with clearance.

* This is still rough around the edges for please fork and submit your improvements upstream so we can make beast work as a rails engine.

* Future direction: once rails 3 is released it may be worth researching how hard it would be to make this a mountable application rather than a rails engine.
